OpenShift is a container application platform that enables developers
and IT architects to design, build and deploy complex multi-component
applications.

Because the platform itself has a great deal of complexity, it is useful to
learn the fundamental concepts and features before embarking on the design of an
application. The tutorials at the left will provide a background on these
fundamental concepts. It will be useful to go through all of them before moving
on to other runtime-specific tutorials. It is also recommended to go through
them in order.
