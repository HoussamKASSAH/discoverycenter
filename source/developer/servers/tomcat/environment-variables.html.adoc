== Environment variables on OpenShift

OpenShift is using environment variables for pushing information into the
applications. It's an effective way how to dynamically reconfigure applications
without the need to change the source code at all and even without the need
to rebuild the application container.

Consuming information from environment allows you to build application once and
then using the information tweak it's behaviour based on the environment where
ti's currently deployed.

Most common tasks for environment variables is to provide information where
to connect to data stores, etc.
