This is the introduction. It should give a quick overview of what's going to
happen. You should always have an introduction - it is required.

This second paragraph is where you can put a little more detail. You might want
to have an external link to the technology or some more background information
to let the reader know about what they are about to do. It is also required. Do
not add another paragraph. Make sure all sections have anchors. The intro
requires the correct role. Put a horizontal line after the introduction section.
