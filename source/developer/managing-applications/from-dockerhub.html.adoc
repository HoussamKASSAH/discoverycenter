== Deploying containers from DockerHub

OpenShift allows you to deploy not only application source code using the
builder images, but you can deploy pretty much any container from DockerHub or
any other Docker repository.

=== OpenShift restrictions on containers
OpenShift Online being a public service puts high requirements on the security
of user data. And for this particular reason, not every single container is not
allowed to run on the platform. The general problem we see everyday is that
containers are trying to run as `root`. Is that a good idea? Not really, would
you let the application running directly on the OS run as root? No! You would
not and the same is with container. Applications should run as a regular use.

OpenShift does enforce this and because not all images are build in the sane way
you may run into problem with some containers. What going to happen in that case?
As you try to create the application you will see this notice

[source]
----
* WARNING: Image "<something>" runs as the 'root' user which may not be permitted by your cluster administrator
----

In such a case you would need to build (if you are the owner) or rebuild (if you
just want to use someone's image) the image to not expect to be run as root.

=== Deploying the containers

To deploy custom containers, you need to use the terminal as it's not yet exposed
int he web UI. You will use the `oc` client tool with the `new-app` command as
you usually use for deploying stuff on OpenShift.

[source]
----
oc new-app jenkins
----

Running this command deploys the official Jenkins container from DockerHub. You
should see output something like this

[source]
------>
Found image 53a7c1e (5 weeks old) in image stream "jenkins" in project "openshift" under tag "1" for "jenkins"

    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "jenkins"
    * Ports 50000/tcp, 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "jenkins"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "jenkins"
    * This image declares volumes and will default to use non-persistent, host-local storage.
      You can add persistent volumes later by running 'volume dc/jenkins --add ...'

--> Creating resources with label app=jenkins ...
    deploymentconfig "jenkins" created
    service "jenkins" created
--> Success
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
----

Once deployed you need to expose the service provided by the container, in this
case it would be

[source]
----
oc expose svc jenkins
----

and check what you URL looks like

[source]
----
oc status
----

open the URL in your browser and you will be able to log in using the `admin`
and `password` credentials.

Voil√†, you just deployed Jenkins using a prebuild container from DockerHub.
