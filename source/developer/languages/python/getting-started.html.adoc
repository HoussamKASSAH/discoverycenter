== Python Getting Started
toc::[]

With OpenShift you can easily deploy and run Python applications. In this tutorial you will learn how to deploy a sample Python application, make modifications to it, and deploy your changes.

The tutorial assumes you have access to an OpenShift environment, installed the `oc` command line client, and have created a project to work in. You will also need an account on GitHub so you can fork the sample application used by this tutorial.

=== Step 1: The Sample Application

The sample application code repository used in this tutorial can be found on GitHub at:

* https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/python-flask-gunicorn

To work through this tutorial you should first create a link:https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/[fork] of this repository into your own GitHub account.

Once you have forked the sample code repository, take note of the HTTPS URL you would use if cloning your copy of the repository. You will need this URL when deploying the sample application.

=== Step 2: Deploying the Application

To deploy the sample application with OpenShift you can use either the OpenShift web console, or the `oc` command line client.

If using the OpenShift web console, you should select _Add to Project_ when in your project. From the _Select Image or Template_ screen, enter `python` in the _Filter by keyword_ field to list only builder images, templates or quick starts related to Python.

Select `python:2.7` from the list of builder images displayed. Enter in `myapp` as the _Name_ for your application, and set the _Git Repository URL_ to be the HTTPS URL which would be used to clone your fork of the sample application code repository.

You can now select _Create` and the building and deployment of the sample application will start.

Select _Continue to overview_ to view progress as the sample application is built and deployed. When complete, the overview page should show a single instance of your application as having being deployed.

The _SERVICE_ panel within the overview for the sample application will display the public URL at which the sample application can be accessed. You can click on the displayed link to go directly to it. The sample application should display 'Hello World!'.
